# Imageboard-server

This is the backend server to be used with imageboard-web. It is intended to be
a classic image-board website clone.

### How to use

In a terminal, you can use `docker-compose up` to start the Postgresql database.

In a second terminal, you can use `dotnet watch run` to start the server with
hot-reloading. Whenever you change a file in imageboard-server, the server will
restart (Might have to wait a second or two)
